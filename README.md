# Flood-Risk-Analysis
This project presents a unified model for enabling information-rich queries for a flood risk-management system. The unified model consists of information derived from excel spreadsheets detailing measurement details about gauges and rivers in flood-prone areas and also from a government report known as Section19. The Setion19 report is a PDF document and contains important information about flood-prone areas and the emergency responses applied to these areas as a result of government decision. Scientists from the flood community would like to bring together all the information pertaining to the flood-prone areas so that they can make information-rich queries, which can help them to draw better insight from this information. 

The challenge lies in extracting information from such a highly unstructured document and bringing the information together with the information from the Excel spreadsheets. 


The unified model has been built using Semantic Web technologies and the extraction of information integrating disparate data sets containing flood-related data, and which allows enriched queries. The extraction of information from the unstructured data source has been achieved through the use of Natural Language Processing techniques.
